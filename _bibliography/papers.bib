 abstract = {Plastic pollution in the sea is an environmental hazard, negatively impacts marine life, and causes economic damage all over the world. It is estimated that each year 8 million tonnes of plastic are deposited in seas, the vast majority coming from rivers. In recent years, publicly available satellite imagery has been used to attempt to track floating plastic debris, using specialized hand-crafted features. In this work, we present an automatic learning approach based on satellite imagery that can detect floating plastic debris in rivers with high precision. This approach is based on well-proven image segmentation architectures, U-Net (RonnebeRger et al., 2015) and DeeplabV3+ (Chen et al., 2018), which we adapt to process high-dimensional multispectral images. To train and test the approach, we also present a dataset of images from different rivers around the world containing floating plastic debris, which is a key step to …},

@article{Da_TlhIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,
 abstract = {In the diffraction resolution of crystal structures, thermal ellipsoids are a critical parameter that is usually more difficult to determine than atomic positions. These ellipsoids are quantified through Anisotropic Displacement Parameters (ADPs), which provide critical insights into atomic vibrations within crystalline structures. ADPs reflect the thermal behaviour and structural properties of crystal structures. However, traditional methods to compute ADPs are computationally intensive. This paper presents CartNet, a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed to predict properties of crystal structures efficiently by encoding the atomic structural geometry to the Cartesian axes and the temperature of the crystal structure. Additionally, CartNet employs a neighbour equalization technique for message passing to help emphasise the covalent and contact interactions and a novel Cholesky-based head to ensure valid …},

 abstract = {Molecular qubits represent a promising avenue for advancing quantum sensing and computing technologies, yet significant challenges remain in optimising their performance. Hyperfine coupling has a critical influence on molecular qubit properties. While previous studies have exhaustively investigated this phenomenon, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms across different systems remains elusive. A benchmark test was performed using DFT to assess which methodology worked best to accurately predict hyperfine coupling constants in molecular qubits predominantly composed of VIV and CuII. We systematically analysed the decomposition of hyperfine coupling and examined how variations in coordination sphere and molecular geometry impact dipolar, isotropic and spin–orbit contributions. By modelling diverse systems, we demonstrate how molecular design can fine-tune hyperfine …},

 abstract = {The detection and recognition of text instances in camera-captured images or videos generate rich and precise semantic information for interpreting and describing the scene. However, recognizing text in the wild remains a challenging problem despite its value. Apart from the inherent problems in text detection and recognition tasks, knowing the language to be recognized is required in unsupervised forensic applications where multilingual information is frequently employed. This work proposes an unconstrained multilingual text recognition pipeline for scene text detection and recognition. The pipeline consists of multiple text recognition experts contributing to determining the output text sentence. Each expert translates the visual information into a candidate text sentence. Finally, our post-processing model, named PolygloNet, encodes and aggregates all text sentences to generate the optimal text sequence. This …},

 abstract = {Crystal structures are characterised by repeating atomic patterns within unit cells across three-dimensional space, posing unique challenges for graph-based representation learning. Current methods often overlook essential periodic boundary conditions and multiscale interactions inherent to crystalline structures. In this paper, we introduce PRISM, a graph neural network framework that explicitly integrates multiscale representations and periodic feature encoding by employing a set of expert modules, each specialised in encoding distinct structural and chemical aspects of periodic systems. Extensive experiments across crystal structure-based benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM improves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy, significantly enhancing crystal property prediction.},

The University of Nevada - Reno intrusion detection dataset (UNR-IDD) is used to evaluate different QML models, including quantum k-nearest neighbors (QKNNs), quantum support vector machines (QSVMs), quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs). These models were tested with quantum simulators to evaluate their potential advantages in processing complex datasets. The results show that HQNN and QSVM have higher accuracy than their classical SVM and NN counterparts. This study shows the potential of leveraging QML to enhance precision.

It is estimated that around 8 million tonnes of plastic every year end up in the sea, the vast majority coming from rivers. In the recent years some interesting approaches to detect these plastics have been proposed using satellite images. However, the difficulty in obtaining datasets makes it a difficult task for classifiers using modern deep learning approaches. The purpose of this project is to develop new tools for the estimation of garbage patches in seas and rivers. Machine learning algorithms that can interpret satellite hyperspectral imaging show viability for identification and monitoring of the plastic debris. In this thesis we will create a dataset with suspected regions of garbage patches and test different deep learning approaches to classify the dataset created. Moreover, we propose a modification for the U-Net architecture and feature reduction techniques for this task.},

 abstract = {Virtual 3D city generation is an essential element in various economical areas such as video games, virtual environments for the film industry, electro-magnetic propagation for the design of telecommunication infrastructures, pollution propagation estimation... Traditionally it must be constructed by hand in a 3D application by a human operator. While this approach gives the operator full control, it requires skills and a lot of time to complete an entire city. In the last years, several tools have been proposed for the automation of the process. However, many parameters such as the width and the length of the roads and the size and the height of the buildings are still set by the operator or randomly generated. The purpose of this project is to develop new tools for the estimation of these parameters from the automated analysis of remote sensing data. High resolution aerial imagery with vertical and oblique viewing angle are convenient sources to estimate the distribution of morphological parameters related to the shape of the terrain, the size and the height of the buildings, and the structure of the road network. In this document we will explain an approach for the estimation of some of these parameters and we will test if it's possible to use this approach also for aerial raw images.},
